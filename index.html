			<h2>What Is Galaxy?</h2>
			<p>A galaxy is a massive system of stars, gas, dust, dark matter, and other celestial objects bound together by gravity. Galaxies come in a wide range of sizes, containing anywhere from millions to trillions of stars. They are the fundamental building blocks of the universe, and there are billions of them scattered across the cosmos. Each galaxy has a central core, which often hosts a supermassive black hole, and they can take on different shapes such as spiral, elliptical, or irregular.
				<br>
				<br>

			One of the most well-known galaxies is the Milky Way, which is the galaxy that includes our solar system. It is a barred spiral galaxy with a flat, rotating disk containing stars, planets, and other materials. The Milky Way is vast—about 100,000 light-years in diameter—and our solar system is located roughly halfway between the center and the edge of the galaxy. When we look up at the night sky and see a band of light stretching across it, we’re seeing a part of the Milky Way from within.
				<br>
				<br>

			Galaxies do not exist in isolation—they are often found in groups or clusters, and even those clusters can be part of larger superclusters. They can interact with each other through gravitational forces, sometimes merging to form even larger galaxies. Over billions of years, these interactions have shaped the universe as we see it today. The study of galaxies helps scientists understand not only the structure of the universe but also its history and future evolution.

		<h2>The Elements of a Galaxy</h2>
		<p>A galaxy is a vast, gravitationally bound system that contains a multitude of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies vary in size, shape, and structure, but they all share several fundamental components that shape their existence. The primary elements of a galaxy include stars, gas, dust, dark matter, and their overarching structure.

	At the heart of most galaxies lies a supermassive black hole, which influences the galaxy's formation and evolution. This black hole is surrounded by a dense concentration of stars, gas, and dust, collectively referred to as the galactic nucleus. The stars in a galaxy can range from young, hot stars to older, cooler ones, contributing to the galaxy’s light and energy output. These stars are often grouped together in stellar clusters, which can be either open clusters (loosely bound) or globular clusters (tightly bound).
			<br><br>

	Galaxies are also filled with large amounts of gas and dust, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. This material is the birthplace of new stars and is distributed unevenly, forming clouds known as nebulae. Gas and dust interact with stellar radiation, giving rise to various astronomical phenomena like supernovae and stellar winds. As new stars are born, they push away surrounding gas, and the cycle of star formation continues.

	An often invisible but essential component of a galaxy is dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that does not emit light. Dark matter makes up a significant portion of a galaxy's mass, influencing its gravitational pull and overall structure. Although it cannot be directly observed, its presence is inferred from its effects on the movement of visible matter.
			<br><br>

	The structure of a galaxy is another defining feature. Galaxies come in various shapes, such as spiral, elliptical, and irregular. The Milky Way, for example, is a spiral galaxy, characterized by its flat disk, central bulge, and spiral arms.

	In summary, galaxies are complex systems composed of stars, gas, dust, dark matter, and black holes. These elements interact in intricate ways, making galaxies the fascinating and dynamic entities that they are.</p>
